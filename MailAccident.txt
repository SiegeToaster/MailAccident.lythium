Player Faction: US Special Forces

Enemy Faction:
	Stealth: Light Takistan Insurgents
	Non-stealth: Heavy Takistan Insurgents, Takistan National Army
	
Time, weather, etc. up to players
	Default is a little after dusk with scattered clouds, no moon. (19:40?)

Premise: US Special Forces attempt to capture an HVT.


Notes/Ideas:
	HVT has a phone/other GPS-using device that players can use to home in on his location; Plus possible decoys or after 1st rescue attempt he loses the phone.
	Add HALO option in addition to start points
	Informant has a few last words to say before he dies, maybe a request (give x to my son or something)
	
Notes/ToDo:
	description.ext - header maxPlayers needs to be updated
